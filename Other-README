This folder contains files that were contributed either internal or
external but are currently not maintained and no plans by the
maintainers to maintain them.  You must download the files in this
directory and extract them to the appropriate directories manually.  It
is therefore recommended that you do not use these files but they are
provided for historical reasons.

  If you wish to take a package and maintain it then please use
  mingw-users@lists.sourceforge.net to convey that fact and the
  maintainers will be in touch with you.  Contributed packages must
  conform to MinGW package standards by using mgwport to do the
  packaging.
